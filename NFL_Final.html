  <h3> Denver Broncos </h3>
  <p>
The Denver Broncos took an early lead in Super Bowl 50 and never trailed. Newton was limited by Denver's defense, which registered seven sacks and forced him into three turnovers, including a fumble which the Broncos recovered for a touchdown. <br><br>
Carolina's defense kept the game close by holding Denver's offense without a touchdown until late in the fourth quarter; defensive end Kony Ealy became the first player in Super Bowl history to have an interception and three sacks. 
<br><br>Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super Bowl MVP; Miller recorded five solo tackles, two and a half sacks, and two forced fumbles in the game.

<h3> Carolina Panthers </h3> 
<p>
Despite waiving long-time running back DeAngelo Williams and losing top wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn ACL in the preseason, the Carolina Panthers had their best regular season in franchise history, becoming the seventh team to win at least 15 regular season games since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978. <br><br>Carolina started the season 14-0, not only setting franchise records for the best start and the longest single-season winning streak, but also posting the best start to a season by an NFC team in NFL history, breaking the 13-0 record previously shared with the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the 2011 Green Bay Packers. <br><br>
With their NFC-best 15-1 regular season record, the Panthers clinched home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs for the first time in franchise history. Ten players were selected to the Pro Bowl (the most in franchise history) along with eight All-Pro selections.
